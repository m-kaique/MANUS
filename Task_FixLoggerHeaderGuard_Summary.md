# Task: Fix Logger Header Guard
**Date:** 2025-06-13 12:45 UTC

## Problem
Header guard comment in `Logger.mqh` was inconsistent and file lacked a terminating newline, which can lead to style issues or warnings in some compilers.

## Solution
Updated the closing `#endif` to `#endif // LOGGER_MQH` and ensured the file ends with a newline. This keeps the guard consistent with other headers and follows standard conventions discussed in the trading guide documentation on clean coding practices.

## Code Snippet
```mql5
#endif // LOGGER_MQH
```

## Manual Testing Instructions
- [ ] Compile `IntegratedPA_EA.mq5` in MetaTrader 5 to ensure no include or syntax errors.
- [ ] Run a quick backtest to confirm normal EA behavior.

## Observations / Notes
- Consistent header guards aid readability and prevent include issues.
