# Task: Review Header Guards
**Date:** 2025-06-13 12:51 UTC

## Problem
Several header files lacked include guards or proper closing comments, leading to potential double inclusion issues and inconsistent style.

## Solution
Added `#ifndef`/`#define` guards and closing comments to all `.mqh` files without them. Ensured each file ends with a newline. This aligns with the documentation recommendation to maintain consistent naming across files (see `fase7_finalizacao_entrega.md`, section "Organização de Arquivos").

## Code Snippet
```mql5
#ifndef CONSTANTS_MQH
#define CONSTANTS_MQH
...
#endif // CONSTANTS_MQH
```
(Changes applied similarly in other header files.)

## Manual Testing Instructions
- [ ] Compile `IntegratedPA_EA.mq5` in MetaTrader 5 and check for include errors.
- [ ] Run a quick backtest to ensure EA behavior is unchanged.

## Observations / Notes
- Consistent header guards help avoid compilation problems when modules are reused or expanded.
